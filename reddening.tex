\section{Reddening and Extinction}

Reddening and extinction are \textit{nearly} the same thing, but not quite. They're both caused by light scattering off dust, but \textit{extinction} describes the dimming that results, and \textit{reddening} describes the preferential scattering of blue light (i.e., more shorter wavelength light gets scattered away from us than longer wavelengths, so we see objects as redder than they actually are.) This is important because it's a pretty large source of systematic uncertainty in supernova studies! Dust doesn't emit light, it just takes it away, so we can't ``see'' it directly. \textit{HOW} are we supposed to correct for an effect we know so little about?
