\subsection{git and GitHub}
\subsubsection{Connecting an existing local directory to a new GitHub repository}
We're a little bit outside the scope of this manual by including this, but I find online guides to using git very confusing... so here we go. Let's say you have a new directory that you want to put on GitHub. From your terminal, \texttt{cd} into that directory, and do the following commands:
\begin{minted}[
    bgcolor=lightgray,
    frame=leftline,
    framesep=-3mm]
    {python}

    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m 'Initial commit'

\end{minted}
This initializes a git repository in the directory, marks all files in the directory for tracking, and records the changes to the git repository locally. Now, check the branch you're on with \texttt{git status}. If this returns ``On branch master'', change your primary branch name from ``master'' to ``main'' by typing \texttt{git branch -m master main}. \\

Now we're going to create a GitHub repository and connect the local git repository to the GitHub repository. So, go to GitHub and create a new repository. I like to name it the same thing as the directory on my local hard drive. Then, after you create the GitHub repository, you should see a place where you can copy its SSH key. Then, go back to your terminal and type \texttt{git remote add origin [SSH key that you just copied]}. Then you'll be able to \texttt{git push --set-upstream origin main} everything to GitHub. If you get an error that says ``git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).", follow the instructions \href{https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh/error-permission-denied-publickey}{here}. 

\subsubsection{Connecting an existing GitHub repository to a new local directory}

\subsubsection{I want to remove files from my repo but they're stuck}
You have to untrack them as well as remove them from the entire commit history. This will do it, and will not delete your files locally, but I hold no responsibility if something else weird happens: 
\begin{minted}[
    bgcolor=lightgray,
    frame=leftline,
    framesep=-3mm]
    {python}

    git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f myfile.fits' HEAD

\end{minted}

Note you can only do this if your commits are up-to-date.

\subsubsection{I want to make a new branch without any parent commits, or I tried using git filter-branch and it won't let me, or everything is really messed up and I'm desperate}

You are probably here because you can't remove some large file from your git history no matter what you do. To get out of this mess, you can make a blank branch with no parent commits and copy your stuff from your previous working branch over to it. 

\begin{minted}[
    bgcolor=lightgray,
    frame=leftline,
    framesep=-3mm]
    {python}

    # Make a new branch. The --orphan tag is key, here. 
    git checkout --orphan newbranch

    git commit -m 'I fixed my working tree issues, hooray'
    git push --set-upstream origin newbranch

\end{minted}

However, now there is a problem with GitHub not wanting to make a pull request to merge the branches because the branches don't share a commit history at all, even though they have a lot of the same content. So, you can give it the history from a different older branch, like \texttt{main}, as long as that branch didn't have a messed up commit history like \texttt{oldbranch} did. 

\begin{minted}[
    bgcolor=lightgray,
    frame=leftline,
    framesep=-3mm]
    {python}

    # To update newbranch so it has history from main:
    git checkout main
    git pull
    git checkout main
    git merge --allow-unrelated-histories -s ours main
    git push

    # If you also want to update main to contain the stuff
    # on newbranch:
    git checkout main
    git merge newbranch
    git push

\end{minted}

Now, \texttt{main} and \texttt{newbranch} are identical and \texttt{newbranch} can be deleted.

\subsection{SALT}
\subsubsection{What is SALT?}


\subsubsection{Model history and publications}
\textit{SALT: a spectral adaptive light curve template for type Ia supernovae}, J. Guy et al. 2005 \cite{salt}. This is the first SALT model. The model is trained on 34 SNe with $z < 0.1$ in $UBVRI$ filters. \\

\textit{SALT2: using distant supernovae to improve the use of type Ia supernovae as distance indicators}, J. Guy et al. 2007 \cite{salt2}. SALT is retrained on data with $z \leq 1$. \\

\textit{Improved cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of the SDSS-II and SNLS supernova samples}, M. Betoule et al. 2014 \cite{salt2.4}. SALT2 is retrained on the data from \cite{salt2}, with the addition of SDSS-II data, for $z < 0.25$. SALT2.4 is born. \\

\textit{SALT3: An Improved Type Ia Supernova Model for Measuring Cosmic Distances}, W. D. Kenworthy et al. 2021 \cite{salt3}. SALT2.4 gets a facelift and becomes more open-sourcey. \\

\textit{SALT3-NIR: Taking the Open-source Type Ia Supernova Model to Longer Wavelengths for Next-generation Cosmological Measurements}, J. D. R. Pierel et al. 2022 \cite{salt3nir}. SALT3 gets upgraded to include NIR wavelengths. 

\subsubsection{How do I use SALT models?}
SALT3 is in several places. You can use these models through:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://sncosmo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/}{\texttt{sncosmo}} (You can use \texttt{SNANA} models in \texttt{sncosmo}, as well.)
    \item \href{https://github.com/RickKessler/SNANA}{\texttt{SNANA}} (SALT2 only)
\end{itemize}

I haven't used \texttt{SNANA}, so I can't help you with that. However, Section \ref{sec:sncosmo} contains tips on using \texttt{sncosmo}. 

\subsection{sncosmo}
\label{sec:sncosmo}
\href{https://github.com/sncosmo/sncosmo}{\texttt{sncosmo}} is pretty cool. It has a whole bunch of contributors. It's a Python package, useful for middle steps of supernova cosmology (e.g., fitting models). You can fit a \href{https://sncosmo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source-list.html}{lot of stuff} with it, actually. \texttt{sncosmo} provides fit parameters for your data. You can use either spectroscopic or photometric data.

\subsubsection{Fitting a light curve with photometry}
You \textit{must} input flux units into \texttt{sncosmo} in order for it to work. Trust me, I've tried using it with magnitudes because I was in denial that I would have to do a unit conversion (boo hoo). These should be \textit{physical flux of your object, not flux of an object in a particular magnitude system} (see \ref{sec:magtoflux}).\\

First, your data needs to be in an \texttt{astropy} table with columns\\
\texttt{[`date',`flux',`fluxerr',`band',`zp',`zpsys']}. 

\subsubsection{Converting SALT parameter output to magnitude error along your entire light curve}

\texttt{sncosmo} contains a function for converting your model fit to a light curve with covariance: \texttt{Model.bandfluxcov()}. You'd use it like this:

\begin{minted}[
    bgcolor=lightgray,
    frame=leftline,
    framesep=-3mm]
    {python}

    import sncosmo 
    import numpy as np
    from astropy import Table
    import pandas as pd

    # Read in your data:
    csv = pd.read_csv('SN2014J.csv')
    # Define band and magnitude system:
    band = 'B'
    phase = np.arange(-10,30,0.1)
    vega = sncosmo.get_magsystem('vega')

    # Turn your pandas table into an astropy table
    # so sncosmo can use it, and fit the model. 
    data = Table.from_pandas(csv)
    model = sncosmo.Model(source='salt3')
    result, fitted_model = sncosmo.fit_lc(data, model, 
        ['t0', 'x0', 'x1', 'c'])

    flux_lc, cov = fitted_model.bandfluxcov(band, phase)      

\end{minted}

where \texttt{flux\_lc} is an array of the flux through your \texttt{band} at all phases in \texttt{phase}. Because I did \textit{not} provide the zero point or zero point system as an argument (\texttt{`zp'} and \texttt{`zpsys'}, respectively), this is the physical flux of the object through the bandpass, \texttt{band} in photons/s/cm$^{2}$. \texttt{cov} is an $n \times n$ symmetric matrix, where $n$ is the length of your \texttt{phase} array. Its entries contain the covariance between band fluxes at different phases. \\

However, \textit{you need to provide \texttt{zp} and \texttt{zpsys} to \texttt{Model.bandfluxcov()} if you are converting to magnitudes, because magnitudes are a relative unit system}. You could also use the ``hidden'' function \texttt{Model.\_bandflux\_rcov()} to calculate the covariances. This calculates the \textit{relative} covariance---i.e., covariances that are \textit{fractions} of the flux. So, if you do this, you need to remember to multiply your covariance matrix by the flux. You can take the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix output from \texttt{Model.\_bandflux\_rcov()}, invoking the assumption that all phases are independent measurements, and convert these to magnitudes using Equation \ref{eqn:errorprop} (or, to skip doing derivatives yourself, Equation \ref{eqn:flux-to-mag-err}). Like so: \\

\begin{minted}[
    bgcolor=lightgray,
    frame=leftline,
    framesep=-3mm]
    {python}

    import sncosmo 
    import numpy as np
    from astropy import Table
    import pandas as pd

    # Read in your data:
    csv = pd.read_csv('SN2014J.csv')
    # Define band and magnitude system:
    band = 'B'
    phase = np.arange(-10,30,0.1)
    vega = sncosmo.get_magsystem('vega')
    # See the section on zeropoint trouble
    # in sncosmo for an explanation of this line:
    zeropoint = csv['mag'] + 
    2.5*np.log10*(vega.band_mag_to_flux(csv['mag'], band)

    # Turn your pandas table into an astropy table
    # so sncosmo can use it, and fit the model. 
    data = Table.from_pandas(csv)
    model = sncosmo.Model(source='salt3')
    result, fitted_model = sncosmo.fit_lc(data, model, 
        ['t0', 'x0', 'x1', 'c'])

    flux_lc, cov = fitted_model.bandfluxcov(band, phase, 
        zp=zeropoint, zpsys=vega) 

    flux_err = np.sqrt(cov.diagonal()) # Multiply flux_err by flux_lc
                                       # if you use _bandflux_rcov().
    mag_err = np.sqrt(((2.5/np.log(10))**2)*(1/(flux_lc**2)) 
        *flux_err**2) 
    

\end{minted}

\subsubsection{\texttt{helio\_to\_cmb()}}
\label{sec:heliotocmb}
The below code is handy for converting your heliocentric redshift to CMB redshift. Honestly, I can't find its location in the sncosmo github right now, so I've copied and pasted it below: 

\begin{minted}[
    bgcolor=lightgray,
    frame=leftline,

                * math.cos(np.deg2rad(ra))
            y = math.cos(np.deg2rad(dec)) 
                * math.sin(np.deg2rad(ra))
            z = math.sin(np.deg2rad(dec))
        except:
            coord = SkyCoord('%s %s' % (ra, dec), 
                unit=(u.hourangle,u.deg))
            x = math.cos(np.deg2rad(coord.dec.degree)) 
                * math.cos(np.deg2rad(coord.ra.degree))
            y = math.cos(np.deg2rad(coord.dec.degree)) 
                * math.sin(np.deg2rad(coord.ra.degree))
            z = math.sin(np.deg2rad(coord.dec.degree))
    
        return np.array([x, y, z], dtype=np.float64)
    
    def cmb_dz(ra, dec):

        return one_plus_z_CMB - 1.
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Help! I'm having zero point trouble.}
\label{sec:zeropointsncosmo}
First, make sure you're inputting \textit{physical flux units}, not the flux of your object in a magnitude system. If you converted from magnitudes to flux, this is likely to be the issue (see section \ref{sec:magtoflux}). So, what you need to do is take your reference spectrum back out of your magnitude.\\

Now, if you've done this, you can't forget to also convert your magnitude errors back to flux errors. It's the same equation as the error equation in \ref{sec:magtoflux}. No funny business with the conversion back to physical units because that's just a constant offset, so the derivative from Equation \ref{eqn:errorprop} takes it out. \\

Here's some Python code to help you out with this fix: 
\begin{minted}[
    bgcolor=lightgray,
    frame=leftline,
    framesep=-3mm]
    {python}
    
    import sncosmo 
    import numpy as np
    from astropy import Table
    import pandas as pd

    # Read in your data:
    csv = pd.read_csv('SN2014J.csv')
    # Define band and magnitude system:
    band = 'B'
    vega = sncosmo.get_magsystem('vega')

    # This is the line where you calculate the offset to 
    # remove the Vega spectrum:
    zeropoint = data['mag'] + 
        2.5*np.log10*(vega.band_mag_to_flux(data['mag'], band)

    # Throw that offset into your table:
    data['zp'] = pd.Series([zeropoint 
        for x in range(len(data.index))])

    # Calculate your flux error (absolute value because it's
    # squared and then square-rooted):
    data['fluxerr'] = abs((data['magerr']*np.log(10)/2.5)*
        (vega.band_mag_to_flux(data['mag'], band))

    # Turn your pandas table into an astropy table
    # so sncosmo can use it, and fit the model. 
    data = Table.from_pandas(csv)
    model = sncosmo.Model(source='salt3')
    result, fitted_model = sncosmo.fit_lc(data, model, 
        ['t0', 'x0', 'x1', 'c'])
    
\end{minted}

\subsection{SNooPy}
\href{https://csp.obs.carnegiescience.edu/data/snpy}{SNooPy} \cite{snoopy1,snoopy2}, written in Python by Chris Burns for the Carnegie Supernova Project, has a lot of handy functions. Broadly, it is a Python package that fits light curves, but it's broken up into a lot of separate functions, which can be very useful. You can run SALT2 and MLCS2k2 models via SNooPy, as well. 


Below, I'll list some of my favorite functions that are not-so-discussed in the \href{https://csp.obs.carnegiescience.edu/data/snpy/documentation}{documentation}. 

\subsubsection{\texttt{get\_dust\_RADEC()} and \texttt{get\_dust\_sigma\_RADEC()}}
\label{sec:snpydustfuncs}

\par
\texttt{get\_dust\_RADEC()} and \texttt{get\_dust\_sigma\_RADEC()} query \href{https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/frontpage/}{IRSA} using a given RA and dec to get the Milky Way $E(B-V)$ and error in $E(B-V)$, respectively. These are located in \texttt{snpy.utils.IRSA\_dust\_getval}. They accept arguments for RA and dec, with the default dust map from \cite{sf11dust}. They return two things: the result and a flag. The flag indicates that the function worked. You can throw this out. \\

\noindent\textbf{Usage example:}
\begin{minted}[
    bgcolor=lightgray,
    frame=leftline,
    framesep=-3mm]
    {python}
    from snpy.utils.IRSA_dust_getval import get_dust_RADEC, 
        get_dust_sigma_RADEC

    '''
    SN 1987A coordinates from 
    http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=SN+1987A.
    Note: At the time of writing this, the get_dust_RADEC()
    function works, but get_dust_sigma_RADEC() is failing.
    Otherwise, this code works as-is.
    '''

    ra, dec = 279.703427, -31.937066
    mwreddening,_ = get_dust_RADEC(ra, dec, calibration='SF11')
    e_mwreddening,_ = get_dust_sigma_RADEC(ra, dec, 
        calibration='SF11')
    mwreddening = mwreddening[0]
    e_mwreddening = e_mwreddening[0]

    print(f'The Milky Way reddening for SN 1987A is {mwreddening}
        +/- {e_mwreddening}.')

\end{minted}

\subsection{mpfit}
\label{sec:mpfit}
\texttt{mpfit} is a very flexible Levenberg-Marquardt $\chi^{2}$ minimization code. It can take error in both the $x$ and $y$ axes into account. It's useful to be familiar with! The Python code is located \href{https://github.com/segasai/astrolibpy/blob/master/mpfit/mpfit.py}{here}. What I think you should do with this is download this *.py file, and make it so it's importable. Then, write some functions that make it easier to use:

\begin{minted}[
    bgcolor=lightgray,

\end{minted}

\section{Packaging your code in Python}

This is possibly the most useful thing that I ever learned to do in graduate school. First of all, I'd like to give props to \href{https://semaphorep.github.io/codeastro/}{Code/Astro} for being an incredible workshop where I learned this. This tutorial will be the barest, most barebones way to package your stuff. This will not cover things like unit tests, licenses, or documents.\\

Let's say we have a file, \texttt{calculate\_magnitudes.py}. It looks like this:

\begin{minted}[
    bgcolor=lightgray,
    frame=leftline,
    framesep=-3mm]
    {python}
    import numpy as np

    def calc_mag(f):
        return -2.5*np.log10(f)
\end{minted}

and we want to be able to import it into a different file because it's an enormous collection of functions and you don't want to copy and paste that monster (just use your imagination, okay?). Let's name our package \texttt{magpy}. You will make a folder with the following structure and contents:

\begin{minted}[
    bgcolor=lightgray,
    frame=leftline,
    framesep=-3mm]
    {python}
    > magpy
        > calculate_mag
            calculate_magnitudes.py
            __init__.py
        README.md
        requirements.txt
        setup.py
\end{minted}

Let's talk about what each of these are, and what goes in each of them. \\

\texttt{> magpy} --- This folder contains everything. It is the highest-level directory in the package.\\

\texttt{> calculate\_mag} --- This folder contains your code. It may also have accompanying data files. \\

\texttt{calculate\_magnitudes.py} --- This is your code. Your functions and tools you want to use exist in here. \\

\texttt{\_\_init\_\_.py} --- This file is run when you first import the package. If you don't want to write a long string of stuff like \\\texttt{from magpy.calculate\_mag.calculate\_magnitudes import calc\_mag}, write the following in this file:

\begin{minted}[
    bgcolor=lightgray,
    frame=leftline,
    framesep=-3mm]
    {python}
    from .calculate_magnitudes import *
\end{minted}

This line imports everything in \texttt{calculate\_magnitudes.py}. So, you can just write \texttt{import calculate\_mag} and then in your code call \texttt{calc\_mag()} directly. \\

\texttt{README.md} --- This describes the software and provides instructions on how to use it. Maybe it has citations, maybe it has a quick code example, maybe it has your name. \\

\texttt{requirements.txt} --- This lists dependencies for your package. For this example, the only thing in this file is:

\begin{minted}[
    bgcolor=lightgray,
    frame=leftline,
    framesep=-3mm]
    {python}
    numpy
\end{minted}

\texttt{setup.py} --- You need this to make \texttt{python setup.py install} work! The most basic setup file looks like:

\begin{minted}[
    bgcolor=lightgray,
    frame=leftline,
    framesep=-3mm]
    {python}
    from setuptools import setup, find_packages

    setup(name='magpy',
        version='v1.0.0',
        packages=find_packages())
\end{minted}

Now, you can install your glorious tools using \texttt{pip install -e .} or \texttt{python setup.py install} from your terminal in the \texttt{magpy} directory. Throw it on github so you can brag about it and put it on your CV, too.
